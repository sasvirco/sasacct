If you want to use the new web interface with
username/password authentication you will have 
to install CGI::Session module from CPAN.
The easiest way to do this is by using
the CPAN.pm modules provided with your perl
distribution. 

bash# perl -MCPAN -e shell 
cpan> install CGI::Session

After installing the module you have to copy
the sasacct.users file from ../etc/ to /etc/
and edit it to fit your needs. The format is 
username:password:ip,ip,ip
where ip is valid sasacct logfile wich can be
found in /var/sasacct/.
You can add special user admin wich will
have the ability to see the traffic for
all accounted hosts.
admin:adminpass:All
By default this user isn't there.

Copy sasacct.cgi to the cgi-bin directory 
of your web server. Copy .gif files in the 
directory where sasacct graphics will be made 
and edit sasacct.cgi ($logopath)
to point to the location.
