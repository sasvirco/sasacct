I .Introduction
Cimon is a package for monitoring the load on cisco family
products via snmp. It monitors and displays the cpu 5 minutes
utilization in percents and free+used Processor memory. The so 
called I/O(1000,2000,3000 series)memory(usualy 2 MB)
is being monitored too, but there isn't graphic for it.
Cimon is good source for information about your router's health.
It also creates files with traffic accounting information (input output bytes)
if your router is configured to make ip accounting. For more information
about how to enable ip accounting on cisco routers reffer to the cisco site

II. Packages Needed
You will need rrdtool http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/
After installing it type 'make site-perl-install'.
You'll also need the Net::SNMP and Net::Netmask packages available at CPAN.
search.cpan.org.

Installation instruction for both rrdtool,Net::SNMP and Net::Netmask
are included with the packages.

II.Bugs
I have buggy mind so it's expected to write buggy programs ;).
